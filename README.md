# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
In this analysis, we are working with a peer-to-peer lending services company to redict credit card risk. We will specifically be using Machine Learning to help make a more reliable experience with less risk for people defaulting on loans by selecting better candidates.

-RandomOverSampler
-SMOTE algorithms
-ClusterCentroids algorithm
-SMOTEENN algorithm
-BalancedRandomForestClassifier (bias reduction model)
-EasyEnsembleClassifier (bias reduction model)

## Results:

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)

## Summary:
There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
